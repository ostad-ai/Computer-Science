    "### Priority Queue\n",
    "A **priority queue** is an **abstract data type** that operates similarly to a regular queue or stack, but with one key difference: Each element has a **priority**, and elements are served (processed) based on their priority rather than their order of arrival.\n",
    "- Thus, higher-priority elements are processed before lower-priority ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** If two elements have the same priority, they are usually processed in the order they were added (FIFO — First In, First Out), though this can vary depending on implementation.\n",
    "<br>**Implementation:** While a priority queue defines what operations should do, it doesn’t specify how. So, we need actual data structures to implement it efficiently. One way to implement a priority queue is by using a **heap**. We talked about heaps in the previous post.\n",
    "<br>Generally, we have two types of priority queues:\n",
    "- **Max-Priority Queue:** Here, highest value = highest priority\n",
    "- **Min-Priority Queue:** Here, lowest value = highest priority\n",
    " \n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we implement both max-priority queuue and min-priority queue by use of heaps. Then, we test them with examples. We also give an examplee with Python built-in priority **queue.PriorityQueue**.\n",
    "<br> **Reminder 1:** We are using the built-in heap of Python module **heapq** which is infact a **min-heap** to make the code length smaller. However, we could use the class **Heap** implemented from scratch in the previous post. \n",
    "<br> **Reminder 2:** It is mentioend that **queue.PriorityQueue** is faster and **thread-safe** than our custom priority queue by heap (we could also make it thread-safe). However, the choice between the two methods depends on the application needs and how much customization is needed. \n",
    "- It is noted that **queue.PriorityQueue** has no built-in function **peek**.\n",
