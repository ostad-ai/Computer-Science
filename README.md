1) **Determinant from scratch** with Python by converting matrix to triangular one.
2) **Cramer's rule** for solving a system of linear equations.
3) **Matrix inversion by the cofactor matrix** from scratch in Python. 
4) **Matrix inversion by Gauss-Jordan elimination** from scratch in Python. 
5) **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), one-dimensional,** from scratch in Python. Also, Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) from scratch is also included.
6) **Divide and Conquer:** Quicksort from scratch in Python. 
7) **Dynamic Programming:** Fibonacci numbers in Python.
8) **Singly Linked Lists** from scratch with Python. An example is also given to implement a stack having functions: push and pop. 
9) **Complex numbers, introduction:** Here, we review complex numbers in both rectangular and polar forms by reminding Euler's formula and De Moivre's formula. Also, we review doing arithmetic for complex numbers in Python.
10) **Absolute and relative errors** are reviewed. When we don't know the true value, we may use approximate value in measuring the mentioned errors. A Python example is also provided.
11) **Root finding, Bisection method:** It is a bracketing method to find one root of a continuous function, given the interval [a,b] in which the root exists. It is assumed that f(a)f(b)<0. 
12) **Root finding, False Position method:** This root finding method is also a bracketing method with the same assumptions we make for the bisection method. However, it is usually faster than the bisection method.
13) **Root finding, Fixed Point Iteration:** This is an open method such that it starts by an initial guess of the root, and then it uses an iteration to get closer to the real root.
14) **Root finding, Secant method:** We give two initial guesses of the root. Then, the method creates a secant line which intersects the x-axis at a value that is usually a better estimate of the root.
15) **Matrix-vector multiplication as a linear combination:** It is possible to express the product of a matrix by a vector as a linear combination of the columns of the matrix by the components of the vector as weights. Here, we mention this property with an example in Python code.
16) **Trace of a matrix:** *Trace* is defined on a *square* matrix, which is the sum of the elements on the *main diagonal* of the matrix. We review the trace function with some properties of the trace. Also, we check those properties in an example with Python code.
17) **Determinant:** Determinant is reviewed again here with some of its properties. The *Laplace expansion* is also mentioned. Moreover, **minors** and **cofactors** of the given matrix are computed. 
18) **Euler method:** The Euler method is used to find solutions to *ordinary differential equations*(ODEs). It is a simple method which is also easy to implement. In fact, it is a numerical method for integration, which can be used for *initial value problems* (IVPs). Here, we bring the Python code with an example. 
19) **Monte Carlo method (algorithms):** A Monte Carlo method (algorithms) refers to a broad class of computational methods that use **random sampling**  to estimate numerical results, especially when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to obtain.
These methods are named after the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco, due to their reliance on randomness and chance. 
In the Python code here, we give some applications of Monte Carlo method including *numerical integration*, *optimization*, and *PI estimation*.
